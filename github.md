 GitHub Features
1 Repositories

Repositories are used to store and manage project files, source code, and version history.
They allow developers to organize code in a structured manner and maintain different versions of a project.

2️ Version Control

GitHub uses Git to track changes made to files over time.
It helps developers view previous versions, revert changes, and maintain a complete history of modifications.

3️ Branches

Branches allow developers to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.
Multiple branches can exist in a repository, enabling parallel development.

4️ Pull Requests

Pull requests are used to merge changes from one branch into another.
They allow team members to review code, suggest changes, and approve updates before merging.

5️ Issues

Issues help in tracking bugs, feature requests, and tasks.
They allow assigning responsibilities, setting priorities, and maintaining clear communication within the team.

6️ Collaboration

GitHub enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously.
Collaborators can clone repositories, create branches, and contribute through pull requests.

7️ Releases and Tags

Releases allow developers to mark specific versions of a project.
Tags are used to label important commits such as stable versions or milestones.

8️ Insights and Analytics

GitHub provides insights like commit history, contributor statistics, and network graphs.
These tools help analyze project activity and team contribution
